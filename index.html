<p>I went to highschool and university in Peterborough, graduating from Trent in 2017 with a degree in Environmental & Resource Science.
  Since graduating, I have spent most of my time working in a totally unrelated field, working with dogs.
  I've absolutely loved working with dogs but decided to start pursuing my original career plan and continue my education by obtaining a GIS certificate.

<p>One of my favourite activities is camping and I'm fortunate enough to live fairly close to a provincial park that provides abundant opportunity to explore the backcountry.
  I've highlighted one of my trips there this summer <a href=https://jessicahobbins.github.io/page.html>here</a>.
